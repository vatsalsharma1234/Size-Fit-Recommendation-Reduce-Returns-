# ðŸ‘• Size / Fit Recommendation Service

A minimal **FastAPI microservice** that recommends clothing sizes 
based on user profile (height, weight, gender, brand, category).  
Inspired by real-world challenges in **e-commerce platforms like Myntra**, 
where improving fit reduces product returns and enhances customer experience.
